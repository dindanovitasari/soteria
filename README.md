# Soteria

In Greek mythology, Soteria (Ancient Greek: Σωτηρία) was the goddess or spirit (daimon) of safety and salvation, deliverance, and preservation from harm (not to be mistaken for Eleos). [[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteria_(mythology))]

In Grab, Soteria will bring safety to our beloved Grab passanger by helping Grabbers identify whether the trip is dangerous or safe
